**___Text Summarization (prompt for further upgrades) : ___**

Summarization Feature Status (Baseline Complete):

FastAPI endpoint /summarize is implemented and functional.

Uses Cohere API (or other configured provider) to generate summaries.

Accepts raw text input and returns concise summaries in the response.

Basic testing done with static inputs.

Default summary parameters are used (no customization yet).

No advanced error handling or multiple model switching yet.

Next steps planned: Improve summary quality, add options to control summary length or style, enhance error handling, add more text-processing endpoints, and support multiple summarization providers.

How to access it later?
Just ask me anytime with any of these:

“Show my saved bio”

“What do you remember about my summarization feature?”

“Show my progress on summarization”

I’ll pull up this note for you exactly as saved so we stay aligned and can pick up right where we left off.
